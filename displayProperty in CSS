they are 4 display properties in CSS

1.BLOCK --> these tags use up the whole width of html page and block any other element to come on that line
However you can adjust their width but still no elements can come on that same line
eg: <p>, <h1>-<h6>, <div>, list and list items(<ul>,<ol>,<li>), <forms>

2.INLINE --> these tags "DON'T" use up the whole width of html page.Hence they can be arranged side by side if there is space
You "CANNOT" adjust their width
eg: <span>, <img>(image tag), (anchor tags)<a>

3.INLINE-BLOCK -->Can be arranged side by side and width can also be adjuted
eg:image is an "KIND OFF" example

4.NONE -->Just get rid of the element. Make it dissppaer from the page and "NO SPACE IS RESERVED"

Simialar kind off work is done by "visibility: hidden;" also
Only difference is that "SPACE IS RESERVED" while we do this
and the other elements flow around that space
